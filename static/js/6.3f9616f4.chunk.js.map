A short history on how we came up with the name <b>\"BiskuitGem\"</b> is that if\n                        you do a quick google on \"Fancy Gem Biscuits\", you will find this colourful snack which is on of our\n                        all-time favourite snack when we were young. To us, this is a nostalgic snack filled with memories that\n                        never fail to bring a smile to our face :)</p>\n                    <p>As developers, not only do we want to enjoy developing products and solutions, we also\n                        want people who use our products to enjoy them as much as we do. At BiskuitGem, we want\n                        our developers to enjoy the little things in life which makes us happy. Memories of this\n                        snack popped up in our mind as we were finding stuff which makes us happy.
